# Task Input and Status Validation System

## Description

This project is a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter information for two tasks, including each task's title, description, and current status ("todo", "doing", or "done"). It helps simulate task tracking and emphasizes basic JavaScript functionality like loops, conditionals, and user input handling through the prompt() and alert() methods.

## Features

 - Motivational feedback if no tasks are marked as done

 - Clear inline code comments for better understanding
